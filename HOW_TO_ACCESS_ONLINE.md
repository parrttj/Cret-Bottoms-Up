# How to Enable GitHub Pages and Access the Application Online

To enable GitHub Pages for your repository and access the application as a live webpage, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your Repository**: Go to your GitHub repository where your application is hosted.

2. **Go to Settings**: On the repository page, click on the `Settings` tab located at the top of the page.

3. **Select Pages**: Scroll down to the `Pages` section in the settings menu.

4. **Source Selection**: In the GitHub Pages section, you will see a `Source` dropdown. Select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (commonly `main` or `gh-pages`). If prompted, choose the folder (usually `/root` for the main branch).

5. **Save**: Click the `Save` button to apply your changes.

6. **Wait for Deployment**: After saving, GitHub will process your request. You should see a message confirming that your site is ready to be published.

7. **Access Your Website**: Once the page is published, GitHub will provide a URL where your application can be accessed live. It typically follows this format:  `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

8. **Testing Your Application**: Open the provided URL in a web browser to access your application and test its functionalities.

Following these steps will allow you to successfully set up GitHub Pages and access your application online!
